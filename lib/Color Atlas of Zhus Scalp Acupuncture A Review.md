Zhu's scalp acupuncture is based on the concept of shu points, which are points where the qi of the internal organs flows to the surface. Zhu's scalp acupuncture has nine therapeutic zones that correspond to different body functions and regions. The zones are located on both sides of the scalp, along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral lines. The zones are named according to their functions, such as motor zone, sensory zone, memory zone, etc.
 
Zhu's scalp acupuncture is mainly used for neurological and musculoskeletal disorders, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, chronic pain, etc. It can also be used for other conditions, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, obesity, etc. Zhu's scalp acupuncture has been shown to have remarkable effects in improving motor function, sensation, cognition, mood, and quality of life in many clinical studies.
 
One of the best resources for learning Zhu's scalp acupuncture is the book *Color Atlas of Zhu's Scalp Acupuncture*, written by Dr. Ming Qing Zhu and Dr. Moyee Siu. The book provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory and practice of Zhu's scalp acupuncture, with detailed illustrations and case studies. The book covers the history and development of scalp acupuncture, the anatomy and physiology of the scalp, the location and indication of each zone, the needle insertion and manipulation techniques, the treatment protocols for various disorders, and the prevention and management of complications.
 
The book also includes a DVD that demonstrates the procedures and techniques of Zhu's scalp acupuncture in real clinical settings. The DVD shows how to locate the zones accurately, how to insert and stimulate the needles effectively, how to combine scalp acupuncture with other modalities, such as massage and physical therapy, and how to monitor and evaluate the treatment outcomes.
 
The book *Color Atlas of Zhu's Scalp Acupuncture* is an invaluable guide for acupuncturists who want to learn or improve their skills in Zhu's scalp acupuncture. It is also a useful reference for other health professionals who are interested in integrating scalp acupuncture into their practice. The book is available in both print and digital formats. However, the digital format is not free and requires a purchase or subscription.
  
In this section, we will introduce some of the most common zones and their applications in Zhu's scalp acupuncture. The zones are numbered according to their order of discovery by Dr. Zhu and his colleagues.
 
## Zone 1: Motor Zone
 
The motor zone is located on the anterior part of the scalp, along the midline. It is divided into two subzones: the upper motor zone and the lower motor zone. The upper motor zone is used to treat disorders of the upper limbs, such as hemiplegia, paralysis, spasticity, tremor, etc. The lower motor zone is used to treat disorders of the lower limbs, such as hemiplegia, paralysis, spasticity, ataxia, etc.
 
The needle insertion direction is from front to back, at an angle of 15-30 degrees. The needle depth is about 1 cun. The needle stimulation method is rapid lifting and thrusting, combined with twirling and rotating. The stimulation frequency is about 200 times per minute. The stimulation duration is 2-3 minutes per session, with a rest period of 5-10 minutes between sessions. The treatment frequency is once or twice a day.
 
## Zone 2: Sensory Zone
 
The sensory zone is located on the posterior part of the scalp, along the midline. It is divided into two subzones: the upper sensory zone and the lower sensory zone. The upper sensory zone is used to treat disorders of the head and face, such as headache, migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, facial paralysis, etc. The lower sensory zone is used to treat disorders of the trunk and limbs, such as numbness, tingling, pain, etc.
